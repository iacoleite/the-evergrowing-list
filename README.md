#The evergrowing list

Developed for codeweek 7 offered by Boolean Tech Academy, this project is a functional web application designed to manage a game list. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, it allows users to organize and track their progress through a personalized list of games they want to play (and probably will not).
